"""Generate whatsapp-desktop's icon set from the two masters in data/icons.

The launcher and the tray deliberately do not share artwork: the launcher gets
the plated icon that suits an app grid, the tray gets the bare mark that still
reads at 16px against a panel.

The PNGs are committed so packaging needs no rendering step -- run this only when
a master changes, and never hand-edit the output.

Panels ask for small sizes, so the attention badge is sized as a fraction of the
icon rather than a fixed pixel count; at 16px a fixed badge would swallow the
whole glyph.
